# GitHub Actions Workflow: Build Obsidian Plugin
#
# This workflow automates the process of building the Obsidian plugin.
# It is triggered manually, allowing you to run it whenever you need
# to generate the plugin files. The workflow installs Node.js,
# installs the project dependencies, builds the plugin, and then
# uploads the essential plugin files (`main.js`, `styles.css`,
# and `manifest.json`) as a downloadable artifact.

# This allows the workflow to be run manually from the Actions tab
